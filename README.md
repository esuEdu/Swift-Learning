# Swift Learning Repository

Welcome to the Pure Swift Learning Repository! This repository is designed to help you learn and master the Swift programming language without relying on any external frameworks.

## Overview

This repository contains a series of projects and exercises focused on pure Swift. The aim is to deepen your understanding of Swift by exploring its core features and standard library capabilities.

## Projects

Each project in this repository focuses on different aspects of the Swift language. Explore the projects to gain hands-on experience:

- **Basics**: Fundamental Swift syntax and programming constructs.
- **Data Structures**: Implementations and usage of data structures such as arrays, dictionaries, sets, linked lists, stacks, and queues.
- **Algorithms**: Sorting algorithms, searching algorithms, and other algorithmic challenges.
- **Concurrency**: Understanding and using Swift’s concurrency model, including GCD and OperationQueue.
- **Protocols and Generics**: Deep dive into Swift’s powerful type system and protocol-oriented programming.
- **Error Handling**: Implementing and handling errors gracefully in Swift.

## Goals

- Gain a solid understanding of Swift’s syntax and standard library.
- Implement common data structures and algorithms from scratch.
- Master concurrency and asynchronous programming in Swift.
- Explore advanced topics like generics, protocols, and error handling.
