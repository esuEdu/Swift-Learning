# Swift Learning Repository

Welcome to the Swift Learning Repository! This repository is designed to help you learn and master the Swift programming language without relying on any external frameworks.

## Overview

This repository contains a series of projects and exercises focused on pure Swift. The aim is to deepen your understanding of Swift by exploring its core features and standard library capabilities.

## Projects

Each project in this repository focuses on different aspects of the Swift language. Explore the projects to gain hands-on experience:

- **Basics**: Fundamental Swift syntax and programming constructs.
- **Data Structures**: Implementations and usage of data structures such as arrays, dictionaries, sets, linked lists, stacks, and queues.
- **Algorithms**: Sorting algorithms, searching algorithms, and other algorithmic challenges.
- **Concurrency**: Understanding and using Swift’s concurrency model, including GCD and OperationQueue.
- **Protocols and Generics**: Deep dive into Swift’s powerful type system and protocol-oriented programming.
- **Error Handling**: Implementing and handling errors gracefully in Swift.

## Goals

- Gain a solid understanding of Swift’s syntax and standard library.
- Implement common data structures and algorithms from scratch.
- Master concurrency and asynchronous programming in Swift.
- Explore advanced topics like generics, protocols, and error handling.

## Resources

Here are some recommended resources to supplement your learning:

- [Swift.org](https://swift.org)
- [The Swift Programming Language Guide](https://docs.swift.org/swift-book/)
- [Swift Standard Library Documentation](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swift/swift_standard_library)
- [Hacking with Swift](https://www.hackingwithswift.com)

## Contributing

### Pull Request Guidelines

1. **Fork the repository** and create your branch from `main`.
2. **Write clear, descriptive commit messages**. See the [Commit Message Guidelines](#commit-message-guidelines) section for more details.
3. **Ensure your code adheres to the project's coding standards** and passes all tests.
4. **Update the documentation** if necessary.
5. **Include the task ID in the pull request description**. This helps in tracking the tasks efficiently.
6. **Create a pull request** with a clear title and description of your changes.

## Type of Change

- [ ] feat: (new feature for the user, not a new feature for build script)
- [ ] fix: (bug fix for the user, not a fix to a build script)
- [ ] docs: (changes to the documentation)
- [ ] style: (formatting, missing semi-colons, etc; no production code change)
- [ ] refactor: (refactoring production code, eg. renaming a variable)
- [ ] perf: (a code change that improves performance)
- [ ] test: (adding missing tests, refactoring tests; no production code change)
- [ ] chore: (updating build tasks, package manager configs, etc; no production code change)

## Checklist

- [ ] My code follows the style guidelines of this project.
- [ ] I have performed a self-review of my own code.
- [ ] I have commented my code, particularly in hard-to-understand areas.
- [ ] I have made corresponding changes to the documentation.
- [ ] My changes generate no new warnings.
- [ ] I have added tests that prove my fix is effective or that my feature works.
- [ ] New and existing unit tests pass locally with my changes.

### Commit Message Guidelines

- **Format**: Use the present tense ("Add feature" not "Added feature").
- **Structure**:
  - **Header**: A single line summary of the commit prefixed with a type.
  - **Body** (optional): Detailed explanation of the changes, if necessary. Separate paragraphs with a blank line.
  - **Footer** (optional): Any additional information, such as breaking changes or issues closed.
- **Types**:
  - `feat:` A new feature
  - `fix:` A bug fix
  - `docs:` Documentation only changes
  - `style:` Changes that do not affect the meaning of the code (white-space, formatting, missing semi-colons, etc.)
  - `refactor:` A code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature
  - `perf:` A code change that improves performance
  - `test:` Adding missing or correcting existing tests
  - `chore:` Changes to the build process or auxiliary tools and libraries such as documentation generation
- **Examples**:
  - `feat: add implementation for binary search algorithm`
  - `fix: resolve issue with array index out of bounds`
  - `docs: update README with commit message guidelines`
  - `style: reformat code according to SwiftLint rules`
  - `refactor: simplify data structure initialization logic`
  - `perf: optimize sorting algorithm for large datasets`
  - `test: add tests for new concurrency features`
  - `chore: update CI configuration for new testing framework`
